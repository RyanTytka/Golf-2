high priority:
add: camera track ball while moving
bug: using arrow keys to move course before clicking makes bg jump
bug: type icons not showing on cards
bug: had empty space in hand either from driver being tossed or from sand or from ability played
bug: ball is visible in the shop
bug: there is an error when no roll
bug: breaks when scroll course while swinging
bug: hit escape key in shop gives error. need settings menu anyways
add: view bag button in shop
add: add back in new distance markers (one above ball, one when mouse highlights course piece)
bug: dragging card while waiting for discard triggers playable wiggles
bug: waiting for discard needs to straighten oout displayed card (and show discard area)
bug: selecting card in hand resets it sort order
low:
bug: swing arc appears in front of ball while swinging
add: roll over make it say luck used instead of penalty if you have luck
add: animation/indicator for drivers
bug: clicking on a card in hand will lower it slightly while keeping it large
add: better wait for discard graphics (transulcent black over everything but hand, drag card to middle of screen to discard)

ready for test:
-- (this was intended. need to update card desc)--bug: "dig through bag" card has timing issues (discards before done drawing)  
--bug: "lone ranger" card does not update its carry text when hand changes 
--bug: clouds can appear on screen
--bug: while waiting for discard, need to disable card play wiggle indication of displayed card
--add: ball move speed scale with shot length. also scale curve with roll length (no roll means ball slows down at end)
--add: support for reverse ball rolling
--better caddie art/animation
