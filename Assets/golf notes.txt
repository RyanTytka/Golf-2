scorecard headers
status effect graphics
need new view bag Icon
view bag throws errors
view bag does not hide course
display course num in UI
hole num should be flag icon
need new tees Icon
make cards more readable
new ball sprite
better shot preview arc
more bg elements


high priority:
add: camera track ball while moving
bug: using arrow keys to move course before clicking makes bg jump
bug: type icons not showing on cards
bug: had empty space in hand either from driver being tossed or from sand or from ability played
bug: ball is visible in the shop
bug: there is an error when no roll
bug: breaks when scroll course while swinging
bug: hit escape key in shop gives error. need settings menu anyways
add: view bag button in shop
add: add back in new distance markers (one above ball, one when mouse highlights course piece)
low:
bug: swing arc appears in front of ball while swinging
add: roll over make it say luck used instead of penalty if you have luck
add: animation/indicator for drivers
add: better wait for discard graphics (transulcent black over everything but hand, drag card to middle of screen to discard)

--bug: not using driver (tossing in general) removes it permanently?
-- (this was intended. need to update card desc)--bug: "dig through bag" card has timing issues (discards before done drawing)  
--bug: "lone ranger" card does not update its carry text when hand changes 
--bug: clouds can appear on screen
--bug: hovering over a card while it is being drawn (after arc but before moves to hand freezes it in place)
--bug: drawing an ability after playing it has permanent play indication wiggles and moved from off screen weirdly
--bug: waiting for discard needs to straighten oout displayed card (and show discard area)
--bug: while waiting for discard, need to disable card play wiggle indication
--add: ball move speed scale with shot length. also scale curve with roll length (no roll means ball slows down at end)
--add: support for reverse ball rolling
-not needed--add: make sand discard on roll over instead of at the end of roll
--better caddie art/animation

	-club: Toss this after use
	-caddie: when you toss one or more cards, draw a card
	-ability: if you have 5 or more tossed cards, lose 1 stroke. Toss this.
club: +10 carry  for each card drawn while this is in your hand
