scorecard headers
status effect graphics
need new tees Icon
make cards more readable
new ball sprite
better shot preview arc
more bg elements
view discard pile
add putting mechanic

high priority:
add new distance markers (one above ball, one when mouse highlights course piece)
waiting for discard does not show instructions 
view deck can still drag course display
disable selecting cards once hole is done
help screen is behind course and ball and hand
rival display is behind course

low:
pause can still hover cards in hand (but not click them)
using arrow keys to move course before clicking makes bg jump (not always based on bg element distance maybe?)
roll over make it say luck used instead of penalty if you have luck
add animation/indicator for drivers
add better wait for discard graphics (transulcent black over everything but hand, drag card to middle of screen to discard)
when play a caddie, make the move duration scale with distance moved
change view bag button from a button to just clicking the bag
add camera track ball while moving
dont delete hand/caddie/hole displays after hole until screen moves up


ready for test:
(this was intended. need to update card desc)--bug: "dig through bag" card has timing issues (discards before done drawing)  
bug: "lone ranger" card does not update its carry text when hand changes 
bug: clouds can appear on screen
add: support for reverse ball rolling


card ideas:
toss synergy
	-club: Toss this after use
	-caddie: when you toss a card, gain 10 power.
	-Ability: Can't be played. When this is tossed, draw 2.
club: +10 carry  for each card drawn while this is in your hand
