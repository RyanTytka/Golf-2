high priority:
add: camera track ball while moving
bug: using arrow keys to move course before clicking makes bg jump (not always)
bug: had empty space in hand either from driver being tossed or from sand or from ability played
bug: ball is visible in the shop
bug: there is an error when no roll
bug: breaks when scroll course while swinging
bug: hit escape key in shop gives error. need settings menu anyways
add: view bag button in shop
add: add new distance markers (one above ball, one when mouse highlights course piece)
bug: waiting for discard does not show instructions 
bug: ball is behind course while moving
bug: caddie display does not delete between holes
add: update caddie display with pic of caddie
low:
bug: swing arc appears in front of ball while swinging
add: roll over make it say luck used instead of penalty if you have luck
add: animation/indicator for drivers
add: better wait for discard graphics (transulcent black over everything but hand, drag card to middle of screen to discard)


ready for test:
-- (this was intended. need to update card desc)--bug: "dig through bag" card has timing issues (discards before done drawing)  
--bug: "lone ranger" card does not update its carry text when hand changes 
--bug: clouds can appear on screen
--add: ball move speed scale with shot length. also scale curve with roll length (no roll means ball slows down at end)
--add: support for reverse ball rolling
--better caddie art/animation


card ideas:
toss synergy
	-club: Toss this after use
	-caddie: when you toss a card, gain 10 power.
	-Ability: Can't be played. When this is tossed, draw 2.
club: +10 carry  for each card drawn while this is in your hand
