scorecard headers
status effect graphics
need new tees Icon
make cards more readable
new ball sprite
better shot preview arc
more bg elements
view discard pile
add putting mechanic
should caddies be unique? but what about random caddie generation?

high priority:
add new distance markers (one above ball, one when mouse highlights course piece)
waiting for discard does not show instructions 
view deck can still drag course display
disable selecting cards once hole is done
help screen is behind course and ball and hand
rival display is behind course

low:
pause can still hover cards in hand (but not click them)
using arrow keys to move course before clicking makes bg jump (not always based on bg element distance maybe?)
roll over make it say luck used instead of penalty if you have luck
add animation/indicator for drivers
add better wait for discard graphics (transulcent black over everything but hand, drag card to middle of screen to discard)
when play a caddie, make the move duration scale with distance moved
change view bag button from a button to just clicking the bag
add camera track ball while moving

ready for test:
(this was intended. need to update card desc)--bug: "dig through bag" card has timing issues (discards before done drawing)  
bug: "lone ranger" card does not update its carry text when hand changes 
bug: clouds can appear on screen
add: support for reverse ball rolling
desert course is almost all sand (fairway was set to sand, I undid this)
clicking take card before camera is done scrolling after hole breaks shop
dont delete hand/caddie/hole displays after hole until screen moves up


idea: cart path tile that makes ball roll further, or bounce on it to get more distance

card ideas:


ideas for upgrades:
-hat or something. add to caddie and makes it level 2 caddie
-similar upgrade for upgrades. Or have specific ones that draw, give extra stats, etc

Or remove upgrades entirely and do artifact system (although this requires more artwork) and refactoring

add upgrades to new card select? Or cart girl comes with upgrades mid hole? Or in shop, can't buy any cards, but can reroll upgrades as much as you want (same as new card select, although you can buy each time)
