high priority:
implement and test new cards
courses too long/varied (410, 500yd, ?, 450 par 4 crs 1,2,3,4)
balance tee earnings/costs
distance data marker is in front when waiting for discard
hazards display stoke penalty particle even if you have luck

low:
shooting backwards swing animation happens instantly
distance data marker is in front of ability card while dragging it to play area
scorecard headers
need new tees Icon
new ball sprite
better shot preview arc
make cards more readable
more bg elements
view discard pile
add putting mechanic
disable selecting cards once hole is done
view deck can still drag course display
clubs that have variable stats need to update their card text. (also change color when modified to indicate)
pause can still hover cards in hand (but not click them)
using arrow keys to move course before clicking makes bg jump (not always based on bg element distance maybe?)
roll over make it say luck used instead of penalty if you have luck
add animation/indicator for drivers
when play a caddie, make the move duration scale with distance moved
add camera track ball while moving
dont delete hand/caddie/hole displays after hole until screen moves up
clicking card while waiting for discard and dragging mouse fast breaks hovering/dragging card
can drag course while waiting for discard. (or make it so you can and turn full black panel into just an area?)
move distance data marker to manager script so it does not snap to start of animation


ready for test:
(this was intended. need to update card desc)--bug: "dig through bag" card has timing issues (discards before done drawing)  
bug: "lone ranger" card does not update its carry text when hand changes 
bug: clouds can appear on screen
add: support for reverse ball rolling


idea: cart path tile that makes ball roll further, or bounce on it to get more distance

card ideas:


ideas for upgrades:
-hat or something. add to caddie and makes it level 2 caddie
-similar upgrade for upgrades. Or have specific ones that draw, give extra stats, etc

Or remove upgrades entirely and do artifact system (although this requires more artwork) and refactoring

add upgrades to new card select? Or cart girl comes with upgrades mid hole? Or in shop, can't buy any cards, but can reroll upgrades as much as you want (same as new card select, although you can buy each time)

housesitting:
modular generated houses
random assortment of rules each time
use player's mic?
have some kind of monster in the house? (maybe only if you break certain rules)
don't tell the player the rules and they have to figure it out by trial/error? have multiple scenarios/jobs?
or have rules be very vague
rules:
- if you hear knocking, close the curtains
- if someone is standing outside on the sidewalk, make sure the front lights are on
- never turn on the TV before 3AM
- never have more than 1 faucet running
- if the lights turn off, hide until you hear the front door open
- if you walk into a room and everything goes quiet, do not move until sound returns
- if the lights don't turn on, hide in a closet
- if a clock chimes while you are on the stairs, go back the way you came without turning around
- if bathtub/sink is full of water, drain it immediately. If the water has turned red, turn the radiio/TV on as loud as you can
- if you hear a dog barking, go open the back door.
